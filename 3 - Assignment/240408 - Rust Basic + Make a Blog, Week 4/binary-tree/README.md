# Exercise: Binary Tree

A binary tree is a tree-type data structure where every node has two children
(left and right). We will create a tree where each node stores a value. For a
given node N, all nodes in a N's left subtree contain smaller values, and all
nodes in N's right subtree will contain larger values.

Extra Credit: Implement an iterator over a binary tree that returns the values
in order.
