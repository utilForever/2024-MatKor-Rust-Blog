# Exercise: Mandelbrot Set - Lock Free

This exercise is a simple implementation of the Mandelbrot set using lock-free programming.

## Context

Lock-based programming is a common way to protect shared resources in a multi-threaded environment. However, lock-based programming can be inefficient in some cases, especially when the critical section is small and the contention is high. In such cases, lock-free programming can be a better alternative.
