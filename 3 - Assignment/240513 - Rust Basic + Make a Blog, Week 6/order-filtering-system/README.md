# Exercise: The Order Filtering System

Create a system to filter only certain orders in your order list based on multiple conditions. For example, you might want to filter for orders with <b>a price of 100 or more</b>, or <b>for items ordered by a specific customer</b>. Pass multiple conditions to your closers, leaving only orders that meet all of them.
