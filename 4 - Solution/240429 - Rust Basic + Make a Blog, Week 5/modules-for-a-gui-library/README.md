# Exercise: Modules for a GUI Library

In this exercise, you will reorganize a small GUI Library implementation. This
library defines a `Widget` trait and a few implementations of that trait, as
well as a `main` function.

It is typical to put each type or set of closely-related types into its own
module, so each widget type should get its own module.

Edit the resulting `src/main.rs` to add `mod` statements, and add additional
files in the `src` directory.
