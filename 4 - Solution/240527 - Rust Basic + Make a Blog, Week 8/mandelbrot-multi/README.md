# Exercise: Mandelbrot Set - Multi Thread

This exercise is a simple implementation of the Mandelbrot set using multiple threads (`spawn()` and `join()`).

## Context

`The Mandelbrot Set - Single Thread` is slow because it uses only one thread to calculate the Mandelbrot set. In this exercise, you will use multiple threads to calculate the Mandelbrot set faster. You should change code to use `spawn()` and `join()`.
